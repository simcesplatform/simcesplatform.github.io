# Running a simulation

Once you have installed the platform (see [Installation](core_install.md)), use the following instructions to start a simulation run.

All the files mentioned in these instructions are part of the installation and can be found in the installation folder, i.e. in the `platform` folder if the platform installation instruction were followed.

Current version of simulation platform can only start one simulation run at a time. I.e., the simulations are started by running [Platform Manager](core_platformmanager.md) which is given the simulation run configuration at the startup and after finishing the simulation start procedures Platform Manager closes itself.

## Testing the platform Installation

- To test the platform installation, see the page [Running first test simulation](core_run-first.md)
- To test the platform with the Energy Community demo scenario, see the page [Running EC scenario demo simulation](energy_run-ec-demo.md)
- Additionally, to test the platform with an additional demo scenario, see the page [Running the EV Charging demo scenario simulation](energy_run-ev-charging-demo.md)
